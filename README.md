This HTML code snippet creates a movie theater seating selection interface with seat legends, movie details, selected seat tracking, and cancel/proceed buttons.

**Movie Theater Seating Selection Interface**

This project consists of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a movie theater seating selection interface. Users can select their preferred seats for a chosen movie, view the selected seats, and proceed to confirm their booking.

**Features:**

1. **Movie Selection:** Users can choose from a list of available movies along with their respective prices.

2. **Seating Interface:** The left section of the interface displays the theater's seating arrangement. Seats are categorized as available, selected, or occupied. Users can click on available seats to select them.

3. **Seat Legends:** A legend at the top of the seating section explains the different seat statuses (available, selected, occupied).

4. **Selected Seats Display:** The right section shows the selected seats in a grid. If no seats are selected, a message is displayed indicating so.

5. **Movie Details:** Movie information including the movie name, price, and date is displayed at the top of the right section.

6. **Total Price Calculation:** As seats are selected, the total price is updated based on the number of selected seats and the movie price.

7. **Cancel and Proceed Buttons:** Users can cancel their seat selection, which clears all selected seats and resets the total price. The "Proceed" button allows users to finalize their booking (if seats are selected), triggering a confirmation message.

8. **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to different screen sizes, with specific layout adjustments for desktop displays.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository or integrate the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your project.

2. Customize the `moviesList` array in the JavaScript code to include your own movie options.

3. Update the movie names, prices, and dates to match your preferences.

4. Add appropriate images or logos to enhance the visual appeal of the interface.

**Note:** This project offers a simple example of a movie theater seating selection interface. You can extend and modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as integrating with backend services for booking and payment processing.
